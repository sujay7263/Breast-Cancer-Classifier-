Breast-Cancer-Classifier
Overview Breast cancer has been a type cancer among women which has been on the upward trend the last couple of years. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This classifier uses logistic regression to make predictions based on several features extracted from breast tumor biopsies.

The logistic regression model is trained on a labeled dataset, and its performance is evaluated to determine its effectiveness in classifying tumors as benign or malignant. The dataset we have used is derived from the fine needle aspiration test.

Dataset The dataset used for training and testing the classifier was imported with the help is sklearn. It contains a set of features such as the size of the tumor, shape, texture, and other relevant characteristics, along with their corresponding labels (benign or malignant). '0' being malignant type of cancer and '1' being benign type of cancer.

The results of the breast cancer classifier have been shown through Python scripts.
